      <h3>Hello there, Adam Roth here</h3>
      <p>I am a software developer student with Thinkful in Bradenton, Florida.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>I have been sales for over 10 years. Although, I have enjoyed it at times, I find myself wanting more to my professional world. I found Thinkful and cannot wait to start a new career in web development. </p>

        <p>I consider myself an amateur artist, so here is what I love about web development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using my creativity to design</li>
            <li>Visibly admiring the end product</li>
            <li>Challenging myself</li>
            <li>Chance to work and learn with a team</li>
          </ul>

        <p>When I am not attempting to learn on Thinkful, I spend my time with my family. Having 2 young daughters can be just as challenging as JavsScript, but I would not have it any other way. I enjoy sports, good food, art, ancient history, and a good laugh.</p>
